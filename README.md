   - Know how to optimize code if needed.

2. **Problem-solving Skills:**
   - Break down problems into smaller parts.
   - Develop a step-by-step approach to problem-solving.

3. **Mock Interviews:**
   - Practice mock interviews with a friend or use online platforms that offer mock interviews.

4. **Behavioral Questions:**
   - Be prepared for behavioral questions. Showcase teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills.

5. **Company-specific Preparation:**
   - Research the companies you are interviewing for and understand the types of questions they commonly ask.

6. **Stay Updated:**
